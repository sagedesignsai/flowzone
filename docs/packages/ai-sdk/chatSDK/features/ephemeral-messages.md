# Ephemeral messages

Send messages visible only to a specific user.

Ephemeral messages are visible only to a specific user within a thread. They're useful for confirmations, hints, and private notifications.

## Send an ephemeral message

```typescript
await thread.postEphemeral(user, "Only you can see this!", {
  fallbackToDM: true,
});
```

The `fallbackToDM` option is required and controls behavior on platforms without native ephemeral support.

## Platform behavior

| Platform | Native support | Behavior | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Slack | Yes | Ephemeral in channel | Session-only (disappears on reload) |
| Google Chat | Yes | Private message in space | Persists until deleted |
| Discord | No | DM fallback | Persists in DM |
| Teams | No | DM fallback | Persists in DM |

## Check for fallback

```typescript
const result = await thread.postEphemeral(user, "Private notification", {
  fallbackToDM: true,
});

if (result?.usedFallback) {
  console.log("Sent as DM instead of ephemeral");
}
```

## Graceful degradation

Only send if the platform supports native ephemeral:

```typescript
const result = await thread.postEphemeral(user, "Contextual hint", {
  fallbackToDM: false,
});

if (!result) {
  // Platform doesn't support native ephemeral
  // Message was not sent
}
```

## Ephemeral cards

Cards work with ephemeral messages too:

```typescript
await thread.postEphemeral(
  event.user,
  <Card title="Ephemeral Card">
    <CardText>Only you can see this card.</CardText>
    <Actions>
      <Button id="open_modal" style="primary">Open Modal</Button>
    </Actions>
  </Card>,
  { fallbackToDM: true }
);
```
