# Direct messages

Initiate DM conversations with users programmatically.

Open direct message conversations with users using `bot.openDM()`. The adapter is automatically inferred from the user ID format.

## DM behavior

DMs behave slightly differently from channel messages. When a user sends a DM to your bot, `isMention=true` and the message routes to `onNewMention` instead of `onSubscribedMessage`.

## Open a DM

### From an Author object

The most common pattern — use the `author` from an incoming message:

```typescript
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  if (message.text === "DM me") {
    const dmThread = await bot.openDM(message.author);
    await dmThread.post("Hello! This is a private message.");
  }
});
```

### From a user ID

Pass a user ID string directly. The adapter is inferred from the ID format:

```typescript
const dmThread = await bot.openDM("U1234567890"); // Slack
```

| Format | Platform |
| --- | --- |
| `U...` | Slack |
| `29:...` | Teams |
| `users/...` | Google Chat |
| Snowflake (numeric) | Discord |

## Check if a thread is a DM

```typescript
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  if (thread.isDM) {
    await thread.post("This is a private conversation.");
  }
});
```
